# Excel Searcher - Python

This is a Python code that I have written to search through my excel spreadsheet (that I use to keep track of my card collection).

The script runs on both Windows and Linux OS but relies on the file being in Documents/Spreadsheets/ directory. It also needs the file to be called FFTCG.xlsx but is possible to change the name if needed.

## How to use?
- Make sure the excel file is in the Documents/Spreadsheets/ directory and named FFTCG.xlsx
- Download the code by cloning the repository
- Run the code in an IDE or go to the folder its in and open the command-prompt/terminal inside the folder
- When the command-prompt/terminal opens it should already be in the folder's directory
- Create a Python virtual environment with `py -m venv <file name>` or `python3 -m venv <file name>`

Now just type `Search_fftcg.py` or `python3 Search_fftcg.py` to run it.

## Goals
- Make it into a terminal script so that it is portable and doesn't need command-line to run.
- Record videos for it running on Linux and upload it to this readme.
