# Excel Searcher - Python

This is a Python code that I have written to search through my excel spreadsheet (that I use to keep track of my card collection).

## How to use?
- Make sure the excel file is in the home directory.
- Download the code by cloning the repository.
- Run the code in an IDE or go to the folder its in and open the command-prompt/terminal inside the folder.
- When the command-prompt/terminal opens it should already be in the folder's directory.

Now just type `Python Search_fftcg.py` to run it.
